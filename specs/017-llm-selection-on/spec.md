# Feature Specification: Ollama Network Service Support

**Feature Branch**: `017-llm-selection-on`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "llm selection on first start and in settings must offer use of ollama as a service with network server address"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature requires network-based Ollama support
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users configuring LLM providers
   ‚Üí Actions: Select Ollama, specify network address
   ‚Üí Data: Network server address/URL
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must work on first start AND in settings
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Validation: Before saving configuration
   ‚Üí Authentication: Yes, support required
   ‚Üí Default address: Pre-fill local interface (localhost:11434)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí LLM Provider Configuration with network address field
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - see clarification markers
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Users want to use Ollama running on a remote server or custom network location instead of only using local Ollama installations. This enables:
- Using a shared team Ollama server
- Accessing more powerful hardware remotely
- Testing against different Ollama configurations
- Running LAMA on machines without local Ollama

### Acceptance Scenarios

**First-Time Setup**
1. **Given** a new LAMA installation without saved LLM configuration, **When** user completes first-time setup wizard, **Then** user can select "Ollama (Network Service)" and specify server address
2. **Given** user selects Ollama network service option, **When** user enters a valid network address (e.g., "http://192.168.1.100:11434"), **Then** system accepts and saves the configuration
3. **Given** user selects Ollama network service, **When** user provides network address, **Then** system verifies available models from that server

**Settings Configuration**
4. **Given** LAMA is already configured with any LLM provider, **When** user opens LLM settings, **Then** user can switch to Ollama network service and specify server address
5. **Given** user is editing Ollama network configuration in settings, **When** user changes the server address, **Then** system re-validates connection and updates available models list

**Using Network Ollama**
6. **Given** Ollama network service is configured with valid server address, **When** user initiates AI conversation, **Then** system connects to specified Ollama server for model inference
7. **Given** Ollama network service was previously working, **When** remote server becomes unreachable, **Then** user receives clear error message about network connectivity

### Edge Cases

**Network Address Validation**
- What happens when user enters invalid URL format (e.g., missing protocol, invalid port)?
- How does system handle addresses with/without trailing slashes?
- Should system support HTTPS Ollama servers?

**Connectivity Issues**
- What happens when specified server is unreachable during initial configuration?
- How does system behave if network connection drops during active conversation?
- Should system cache last-known-good configuration?

**Model Availability**
- What happens if remote Ollama server has no models installed?
- How does system handle if previously used model is removed from remote server?
- Should system display which models are available on which server?

**Authentication**
- What authentication methods should be supported - API key, basic auth, bearer token?
- How should credentials be stored securely?
- Should system remember credentials across sessions?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Configuration Interface**
- **FR-001**: System MUST offer "Ollama (Network Service)" as an LLM provider option during first-time setup wizard
- **FR-002**: System MUST offer "Ollama (Network Service)" as an LLM provider option in settings/preferences
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide input field for users to specify network server address when Ollama network service is selected
- **FR-004**: System MUST accept network addresses in URL format (protocol, hostname/IP, port)
- **FR-005**: System MUST distinguish between local Ollama installation and network-based Ollama service

**Validation & Connectivity**
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate network address format before saving configuration
- **FR-007**: System MUST test connectivity to Ollama server before accepting configuration
- **FR-008**: System MUST retrieve and display available models from specified Ollama network server
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear error messages when network Ollama server is unreachable

**Runtime Behavior**
- **FR-010**: System MUST use specified network address when making requests to Ollama API
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle network failures gracefully without crashing application
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist network Ollama configuration across application restarts

**User Experience**
- **FR-013**: System MUST clearly label the difference between local and network Ollama options
- **FR-014**: System MUST pre-fill network address field with "http://localhost:11434" as default value
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow users to test connection to network Ollama server before saving configuration

**Authentication & Security**
- **FR-016**: System MUST support authentication for remote Ollama servers
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide fields for authentication credentials when required by remote server
- **FR-018**: System MUST store authentication credentials securely

### Key Entities

- **LLM Provider Configuration**: Represents user's choice of AI service, including:
  - Provider type (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama Local, Ollama Network, etc.)
  - Connection details specific to provider type
  - For Ollama Network: server address/URL
  - Selected model from provider's available models

- **Network Address**: URL/endpoint for remote Ollama service, including:
  - Protocol (http/https)
  - Hostname or IP address
  - Port number
  - Optional: authentication credentials (when server requires authentication)
