# Feature Specification: Keyword Detail Preview

**Feature Branch**: `015-keyword-detail-preview`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "keyword detail preview opens when a keyword is selected in chat. it is shown in the same place like summaries. it contains subjects with topic references where the keyword also shows up. it must also show an allow and deny list for users and groups"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Interactive keyword detail view in chat interface
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users viewing chat conversations

   ‚úì Sorting: Primary by relevance (places, recency, frequency); configurable by time/author
   ‚úì Empty states: N/A - keywords only exist if extracted from content
   ‚úì Access control: List of all known users with 3-state selector (allow/deny/not selected)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User clicks keyword ‚Üí toggle preview ‚Üí sort/filter subjects ‚Üí manage access
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable via user interaction

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user is engaged in a conversation and notices a keyword in the topic summary or keyword cloud. They want to understand where else this keyword appears, what subjects it's associated with, and who has access to view information related to this keyword. By clicking the keyword, they toggle a detailed preview panel (in the same location where conversation summaries appear) that shows:
- A vertically scrollable list of subjects that include the keyword, showing each subject's description content
- Topic references for each subject indicating where the keyword appears
- Access control configuration with all known users, each having a 3-state selector (allow/deny/not selected)

The subjects are sorted by relevance (number of places, recency of mentions, frequency), and the user can reconfigure sorting by time and author of original information.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a conversation with analyzed keywords, **When** user clicks on a keyword, **Then** keyword detail preview toggles open in the summary panel area
2. **Given** keyword detail preview is open, **When** user clicks the same keyword again, **Then** preview toggles closed
3. **Given** keyword detail preview is open for keyword A, **When** user clicks keyword B, **Then** preview content switches to show keyword B details
4. **Given** keyword detail preview is displayed, **When** system loads subject data, **Then** subjects are shown in a vertically scrollable list with description content visible
5. **Given** multiple subjects are displayed, **When** preview renders subjects, **Then** they are sorted by relevance (number of places, recency, frequency) by default
6. **Given** keyword detail preview shows subjects, **When** user configures sorting options, **Then** subjects can be re-sorted by time or author of original information
7. **Given** keyword detail preview shows subjects, **When** each subject is displayed, **Then** topic references are visible indicating where the keyword appears
8. **Given** keyword detail preview access control section, **When** displayed, **Then** all known users are shown with 3-state selectors (allow/deny/not selected)
9. **Given** user access controls are displayed, **When** user changes a state, **Then** the new access state is saved for that user

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a keyword appears in topics the user doesn't have access to? (Should topic references be filtered by user permissions?)
- How does system handle keywords that appear in hundreds of topics? (Does scrollable list have performance limits?)
- What happens when user clicks a topic reference in the subject list? (Should it navigate to that topic?)
- How are groups distinguished from individual users in the access control list?
- Can users bulk-select access states for multiple users at once?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Display & Navigation**
- **FR-001**: System MUST toggle keyword detail preview open when user clicks a keyword from chat interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST toggle keyword detail preview closed when user clicks the same keyword again
- **FR-003**: System MUST switch preview content when user clicks a different keyword while preview is already open
- **FR-004**: System MUST display keyword detail preview in the same location where conversation summaries are shown
- **FR-005**: System MUST show the selected keyword name prominently in the preview header

**Subject Display**
- **FR-006**: System MUST display subjects containing the selected keyword in a vertically scrollable list
- **FR-007**: System MUST show each subject's description content within the subject list
- **FR-008**: System MUST display topic references for each subject indicating where the keyword appears
- **FR-009**: System MUST sort subjects by relevance by default (number of places, recency of mentions, frequency)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide sorting configuration options to re-sort subjects by time of original information
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide sorting configuration options to re-sort subjects by author of original information
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain scroll position when user interacts with sorting controls

**Access Control**
- **FR-013**: System MUST display a list of all known users with access control selectors
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide a 3-state selector for each user: allow, deny, or not selected
- **FR-015**: System MUST clearly distinguish between individual users and groups in the access control list
- **FR-016**: System MUST save access state changes when user modifies a selector
- **FR-017**: System MUST persist access control states across sessions

**Data Loading & Performance**
- **FR-018**: System MUST load keyword detail data when preview is toggled open
- **FR-019**: System MUST handle scrolling performance efficiently even with hundreds of subjects
- **FR-020**: System MUST display subject data as it loads without blocking user interaction

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Keyword**: Represents an extracted term from messages and attachments in conversation analysis. Has a text value and is associated with multiple subjects and topics. Keywords only exist when extracted from content.

- **Subject**: Represents a theme identified by keyword combinations. Contains description content, one or more keywords, and appears in one or more conversation topics. Has metadata about places mentioned, recency, and frequency for relevance sorting.

- **Topic Reference**: A reference to a specific conversation topic where a keyword/subject appears. Links the keyword detail view to actual conversations. Includes information about time and author of original information for sorting purposes.

- **User Access State**: Represents the access permission state for a user or group regarding keyword-related information. Has three possible values: allow, deny, or not selected. Persists across sessions. Distinguishes between individual users and groups.

## Notes for Planning Phase

This specification defines a keyword detail preview feature with:

**Core Capabilities**:
- Toggle-based interaction model (click to open/close/switch)
- Vertically scrollable subject list with description content
- Relevance-based sorting with configurable time/author options
- 3-state access control system (allow/deny/not selected) for users and groups
- Performance optimization for large datasets

**Remaining Open Questions** (for planning phase):
- Navigation behavior when clicking topic references
- Permission filtering for topic references
- Visual distinction between users and groups in access control
- Bulk selection capabilities for access control
- Scroll performance optimization strategy for hundreds of subjects

**Dependencies**:
- Existing keyword extraction from messages and attachments
- Existing subject analysis system
- User and group management system
- Topic metadata (time, author) for sorting

This feature extends the existing topic analysis capabilities by providing users with deep insight into keyword usage patterns and fine-grained access control over keyword-related information.
