# Feature Specification: Complete TypeScript Migration

**Feature Branch**: `016-complete-the-migration`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "complete the migration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: Complete TypeScript migration of remaining JavaScript files
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers working on codebase
   ‚Üí Actions: convert JavaScript files to TypeScript
   ‚Üí Data: 82 legacy .js files in main/ directory
   ‚Üí Constraints: must maintain functionality, preserve build system
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NO CLARIFICATIONS NEEDED - technical task with clear scope]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear flow: migration enables proper build process
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable via build system
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Source files, build configuration
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No uncertainties, no implementation leakage
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the LAMA Electron codebase, I need all source files to be properly included in the build process so that the application can be built and run without manual file copying workarounds.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the codebase contains both TypeScript and JavaScript files, **When** the build process runs, **Then** all source files are compiled/copied to the dist/ directory
2. **Given** the build has completed successfully, **When** the application is launched, **Then** all modules load correctly without missing file errors
3. **Given** a developer modifies a source file, **When** they rebuild the application, **Then** changes are reflected in dist/ without manual intervention

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a file has complex dependencies on both TS and JS files?
- How does the system handle files that import from JavaScript modules that haven't been migrated yet?
- What happens if the build process encounters type errors during migration?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST process all source files in main/ directory during build
- **FR-002**: System MUST successfully compile TypeScript files to JavaScript in dist/
- **FR-003**: System MUST ensure all module imports resolve correctly after migration
- **FR-004**: Build process MUST complete without manual file copying steps
- **FR-005**: Application MUST launch successfully using only files from dist/ directory
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve all existing functionality after migration
- **FR-007**: Build configuration MUST handle both pure TypeScript and migrated files uniformly
- **FR-008**: Developers MUST be able to run `npm run build:main && npm run electron` without errors

### Key Entities

- **Source Files**: JavaScript files in main/ directory that need migration to TypeScript
  - Currently 82 files across main/types/, main/ipc/, main/core/, main/services/, etc.
  - Must maintain same functionality after conversion

- **Build Configuration**: TypeScript compiler configuration
  - Currently excludes .js files (`"allowJs": false`, `"exclude": ["**/*.js"]`)
  - Must be updated to handle TypeScript-only codebase

- **Build Output**: Compiled JavaScript in dist/ directory
  - Must contain all necessary files for application to run
  - Currently requires manual copying of JavaScript files
